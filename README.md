# freeCodeCamp Interview Questions
Running through various programming interview questions from freeCodeCamp's collection of 696 (plus 20 sample projects) for practice, saving to GitHub for later review and reference.

Each question gets its own directory with a readme containing the solution (plus any additional files, like package.json or other supporting files). This document will index them.

## Why explain them?

First, it might help other people. Second, it helps me remember them a bit better. Third, if someone is trying to evaluate me as a programmer, it not only gives them insight into my thought process, but possibly more confidence that I wrote and understand the code (and didn't copy it).
