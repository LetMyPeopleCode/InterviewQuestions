# freeCodeCamp Interview Questions
Running through various programming interview questions from freeCodeCamp's collection of 696 (plus 20 sample projects) for practice, saving to GitHub for later review and reference.

Each question gets its own directory with a readme containing the solution (plus any additional files, like package.json or other supporting files). This document will index them.

## Why explain them?

First, it might help other people. Second, it helps me remember them a bit better. Third, if someone is trying to evaluate me as a programmer, it not only gives them insight into my thought process, but possibly more confidence that I wrote and understand the code (and didn't copy it).

## freeCodeCamp Data Structures

**A thought on older/obscure data structures in interviews:** I've heard a lot of people complain about coding interviews that ask you to solve problems using archaic data structures that may not even exist in the language(s) in which you're proficient. It sounded like a fair complaint to me until I did a tech-screen where we discussed an archaic electronic game and started talking about how we'd make the most efficient use of that late 70s level of RAM/ROM and processors.

That's when it hit me. Some of these archaic data structures are still around because they were created when resource constraints were much more severe. In modern systems with gigahertz clock speeds and gigabytes of RAM, running virtualized in containers, a couple of bytes here and there doesn't matter. But when you're limited to 32k of RAM and an 8 MHz processor (like when coding firmware), you need to code *very* efficiently.

Also, a number of SDMs have told me (paraphrasing here) "it doesn't matter what language the programmer knows or how many different ones they can use to output 'Hello World!' We're more interested in the depth of their knowledge, because someone with a deep knowledge of programming can always be brought up to speed on whatever language we need them to use." 

Or as I once told an interviewer who asked if I could build a project in a language I'd never used, "a variable is a variable and a loop is a loop. The rest is syntax. If I had two weeks and a book, I could do it." He hired me and gave me two weeks and a book. Not sure how much of that is down to me being a bearded, cis-het, white male who looks the programmer part, how much of that is coding skill, and how much of that is interviewing skill. So take all of my interview success stories with a grain of salt, because I'm not an accurate judge of how much of a part privilege played in my success.
