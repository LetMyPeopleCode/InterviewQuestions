# InterviewQuestions
Running through various programming interview questions for practice, saving to GitHub for later review and reference.

Each question gets its own directory with a readme and a solution. This document will index them.

I certify on my honor that I have coded each of these myself and did not look up the answers online (though I may have used MDN or other JavaScript documentation sites and looked up sub-functions, like how to numerically sort an array with `Array.prototype.sort()`).

## Algorithms
### [Find the Symmetric Difference](./find_the_symmetric_difference)

## Project Euler
### [Multiples of 3 and 5](./Project%20Euler%20-%20Multiples%20of%203%20and%205)
### [Even Fibonacci Numbers](Project%20Euler%20Even%20Fibonacci%20Numbers)
